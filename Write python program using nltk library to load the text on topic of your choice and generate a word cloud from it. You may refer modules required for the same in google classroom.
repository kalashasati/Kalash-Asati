Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence that helps computers understand, interpret, 
and respond to human language in a meaningful way. NLP techniques are used in various applications, such as language 
translation, sentiment analysis, speech recognition, and chatbots. With the advent of deep learning, NLP has made 
significant advancements, enabling tasks like text generation, summarization, and question-answering.
